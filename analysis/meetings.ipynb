    "We discussed interpretations of resistance distance and commute times for a random walk on a graph. A good reference for their connections is https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruzzo/papers/resist.pdf. John suggested it would be important to understand how the $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^T$ covariance relates commute times or some analogous concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "To that end we reviewed the math in Hanks 2017 which provided some intuition. Hanks 2017 introduced a discrete space (graph) continuous time Markov chain for modeling the movement of a population of random-walkers. They proceeded to derive the covariance of the stationary distribution of this process for a large population size limit. We were a bit confused of why there was a constraint for the observations to sum to zero ... $\\mathbf{y}\\mathbf{1^T}=0$ and though it could just be a result of mean-centering the data? Finally, we began to go over how to compute expected coalescent times under the stepping stone and setup the system of equations to solve from Desi's thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will follow up with some more work on setting up those equations and solving them in my simulations. Also John suggested to do asymmetric migration on a square lattice which a bit easier to think about / visualize and try a simulation on a circle with a barrier. "

    "We briefly reviewed the forward in time process for the stepping stone model and how that is quite similar to the model proposed by Hanks 2017. Essentially the intuition is that at a given node we can think of a deterministic change in allele frequency forward in time via a linear combination of the allele frequencies at neighboring nodes and an additional random change due to genetic drift within a node. In the forward in time stepping stone model this random change should have variance that depends on the allele frequency (i.e. due to binomial sampling within a node), particularly proportional to something like $p(1-p)$. The model Hanks 2017 proposes essentially simplifies things by making the variance not depend on the allele frequency and constraining the random change to sum to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also went over simulations I've done, the newest being the uniform on a circle, barrier on a circle, asymmetric on a square. One key idea we discussed was building intuition about weather the migration rates are the same forward in time as backward in times ... perhaps this could explain way the asymmetric simulation simulations are performing poorly for the \"random-walk\" distance. This is something @jnovembre brought up in a previous meeting as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the meeting I found a bug ... I was using the column sum not the row sum when computing the weighted degree matrix for the graph laplacian and once I changed that the \"random-walk\" distance actually fits the genetic distance \"decently\". It would still be important to understand if the migration rates should correspond (fwds vs bckwds) and when they wont.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matthew suggested a couple new simulations and modifications \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the asymmetry example simulate symmetric / uniform migration along the x-axis and a slower rate on the y-axis instead of just one direction on the x.\n",
    "2. Simulate the stepping stone model forward in time for a small example\n",
    "3. Try simulating asymmetric examples in 1d and in extreme cases i.e. only in one direction\n",
    "4. Work out forwards vs. backwards rates at stationarity with all demes having the same effective size\n",
    "\n",
    "Matthew expressed interest in this approach primarily to see if we could have a simple modification to improve the resistance distance approximation whereas inferring asymmetric still might be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to take a step back to brainstorm what is the main goals of this project and how best to tackle them. In general my goals are to develop statistical chops on a interesting biological problem and perhaps see if we can make the EEMS framework more accurate, general and / or faster."

    "We reviewed the derivations I started under the stepping stone model, particularly trying to derived the covariance matrix of the limiting distribution with equal population sizes across demes. I showed the matrix geometric series converges but later recalled there eigenvalue exactly 1 for a stochastic matrix. Thus by definition the geometric series diverges. I also confirmed this with a small numeric experiment. John also suggested looking at an approximation where the variance is linearized and not quadratic, perhaps this would still hold for the rarer frequency spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked a little about the greater vision for the project. John suggested it could be a modest contribution to improve the expected distance approximation but this really depends on how much better it improves things. For instance, maybe it could improve MCMC convergence. He suggested the project would look like doing some theory and then modifying the EEMS code and running simulations / experiments to see how much the change in approximation effects results. \n",
    "\n",
    "John also suggested exploring Monte-Carlo approaches for computing expected distances i.e. running coalescent simulations using msprime given current parameter settings to estimate the expected coalescent times. We discussed the difference running simulations with all samples across the demes versus just individual pairs. We have to consider both the data structure (memory) and efficiency. Roughly, for solving the coalescent times we have $d + $$d\\choose2$ parameters to solve. Barring any tricks solving this system is cubic in the number of these parameters. The resistance distance computation and the \"random-walk\" distance both are cubic in the number of demes not $d + $$d\\choose2$! So for the Monte-Carlo has to be at least $d + $$d\\choose2$ $\\times$ the number of simulations $\\times$ the number of flops needed for each simulation. It could be faster our slower depending on whats needed for each simulation. For large grids its not obvious how long it will take two lineages to meet and thus how many exponentials need to be drawn. What is nice about the monte-carlo approach is that we only need to consider sampled demes! even though our grid could be very large, although this is related to how many migration events are needed before 2 lineages coalesce so there could be some hidden cost there on simulating massive grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed that two areas of improvement in EEMS are models of expected distances and their accuracy and speed. All the approaches we've discussed up to now are on the same order of the resistance distance calculation (ignoring the Monte-Carlo idea). These approaches are used to compute a matrix that still has to be used in the Wishart likelihood which has to compute the inverse scale matrix and log det. This is a computationally heavy step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, John emphasized interest in inferring time varying migration rates. He suggested to try to figure out to parameterize the forward in time model in intervals through time."
