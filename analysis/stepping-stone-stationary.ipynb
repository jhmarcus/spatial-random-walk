    "Consider a single bi-allelic SNP with haploid individuals carrying either the $A$ or $a$ allele dispersed throughout a habitat. The habitat is discretized and defined on a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ over geographic space with $d$ nodes and a migration matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ which specifies the edge weights. Note that $\\mathbf{M}$ can be interpreted as a \"backwards\" migration matrix where $m_{ij} >= 0.0$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^d m_{ij} = 1$. Furthermore, $m_{ij}$ can be interpreted as the probability that an individual in node $i$ has parents from node $j$. Let $p_{i,t}$ be the allele frequency of the $A$ allele at node $i$ and time $t$, here time is discrete as well. Each generation we can describe the evolution of the allele frequency in two steps, first a deterministic migration event where individuals are swapped amongst only neighboring nodes and a drift event which is a random fluctuation in allele frequency in each node proportional to its population size.\n",
