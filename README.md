# spatial-random-walk

An exploration of spatial-temporal random walks for modeling genetic distances

# Notebooks

Here I explore how well various distances based on random walks on graphs predict genetic distances simulated under the coalescent.

* [Isolation by spatial random walks](https://github.com/jhmarcus/spatial-random-walk/blob/master/notebooks/isolation_by_srw.ipynb)

Here I explore fast methods for inverting the graph laplacian implemented in `julia`

* [Fast sparse wishart](https://github.com/jhmarcus/spatial-random-walk/blob/master/notebooks/fast_sparse_wishart.ipynb)

Here I explore the relationship between laplacian smoothing and the spatial-random-walk developed in [Hanks 2016](https://github.com/jhmarcus/spatial-random-walk/blob/master/ref/hanks_2016.pdf)
